Hey there!

I'm a **web application developer**. 👨‍💻

My passion for coding started back in my childhood when I got introduced to ZX Spectrum and began programming in **basic**.

After a hiatus for another job, I returned to my passion - building web applications.

During my tenure at various companies, I gained valuable experience as both a **frontend** and **fullstack** developer. I've crafted a number of applications using **JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js**, and have also delved into databases and learned server setup on **Ubuntu**.

My goal is to become a highly skilled developer capable of tackling complex challenges and creating innovative products.

**Tech Stack:**

Programming Languages: **JavaScript, TypeScript**.
Frameworks and Libraries: **React, Node.js, Express.js**.
Databases: **MongoDB, MySQL**.
Additional Tools: **HTML, CSS, Git, Webpack**.

I'm eager to collaborate!

**Let's create something awesome together!** 🚀
